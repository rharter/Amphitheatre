Dependencies
------------

#### The Movie Database (TMDb)

Amphitheatre uses The Movie Database (TMDb) in order to fetch movie information.

You'll need to sign up as a developer and add your TMDb API Key to your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:
```
TMDB_API_KEY=<your api key>
```

#### Media Player

Amphitheatre does not play the actual video file but serves it to a capable media player application. So you'll need to install a media player as well. MXPlayer is a great player worth checking out.
